# automation_for_linux_apt

A little program that can be used to automate repetitive tasks on Linux (specifically on Ubuntu/Debian, that uses apt) or by begginers that don't know exactly the basic commands of these OS.

Requirements: gcc, snap, apt-show-versions

How to install: first, copy the code or use 'git pull' to transfer the file to your machine. Then, compile it using 'gcc automation_for_linux_apt.c -o <name>' in the local directory (or in the directory that you pulled the file). After this, use './<name>' and the program will be executed.
